# OAuth

You can configure authentication services with external OAuth suppliers, right now Twitter, Facebook and Google are supported.

## 1. Create an App on the platform

For each platform, go to their developers section and follow their guides to create an app.

## 2. Set your Moucharaka Mouwatina's url

They'll ask you for your Moucharaka Mouwatina's auth URL, and as you can see running `rake routes` at your Moucharaka Mouwatina repo locally:

```bash
user_omniauth_authorize GET|POST /users/auth/:provider(.:format)          users/omniauth_callbacks#passthru {:provider=>/twitter|facebook|google_oauth2/}
```

So for example the URL for facebook application would be `yourdomain.com/users/auth/facebook/callback`

## 3. Set key & secret values

When you complete the application registration you'll get a _key_ and _secret_ values, those need to be stored at your `config/secrets.yml` file:

```yml
twitter_key: ""
twitter_secret: ""
facebook_key: ""
facebook_secret: ""
google_oauth2_key: ""
google_oauth2_secret: ""
```

_NOTE:_ Also in the case of Google, verify that the APIs _Contacts API_ and _Google+ API_ are enabled for the application.
