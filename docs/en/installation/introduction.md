# Introduction

These are our recommendations for the different environments and purposes:

- To setup Moucharaka Mouwatina for a production environment we recommend using the [installer](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/installer).

- For developers working on a Moucharaka Mouwatina fork we recommend using a UNIX based system (Linux or Mac) and installing Moucharaka Mouwatina [locally system wide](local_installation.md).

- If you run into problems configuring Moucharaka Mouwatina locally system wide and would like to show Moucharaka Mouwatina for demo purposes we recommend using [Docker](docker.md) in a local machine.

- We also have a [Heroku guide](deploying-on-heroku.md) which can be used for demo purposes in a remote server.
