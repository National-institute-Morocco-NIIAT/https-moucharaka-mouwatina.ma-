    # Change this code when you'd like to add settings that aren't
    # already present in the database. These settings will be added when
    # first installing CONSUL DEMOCRACY, when deploying code with Capistrano,
    # or when manually executing the `settings:add_new_settings` task.
    #
    # If a setting already exists in the database, changing its value in
    # this file will have no effect unless the task `rake db:seed` is
    # invoked or the method `Setting.reset_defaults` is executed. Doing
    # so will overwrite the values of all existing settings in the
    # database, so use with care.
    #
    # The tests in the spec/ folder rely on CONSUL DEMOCRACY's default
    # settings, so it's recommended not to change the default settings
    # in the test environment.
