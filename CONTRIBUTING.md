# How to Contribute to this Project

## Code of conduct

The core team members and the project's community adopt an inclusive Code of Conduct that you can read in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.

## Reporting an issue

The prefered way to report any bug is [opening an issue in the project's repo](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/issues/new).

* Try to use a descriptive and to-the-point title
* It's a good idea to include some of these sections:
  * Steps to reproduce the bug
  * Expected behaviour/response
  * Actual response
* Sometimes it is also helpful if you mention your operating system, browser version and installed plugins.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:

## Solving an issue

[Issues labeled with help wanted](https://github.com/consuldemocracy/consuldemocracy/labels/help%20wanted) are well defined features ready to be implemented by whoever wants to do it.

If you want to contribute code to solve an issue:

* Add a comment to tell everyone you are working on the issue.
* Open a *pull request* to the main repository describing what issue you are addressing and following our [coding conventions](#coding-conventions)

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

## Coding conventions

If you'd like us to review your pull request in good spirits, please follow our coding conventions:

* Include specs to test any changes you've made
* Our CI will check whether the rest of the application is still working properly; check its build and make sure all tests are passing
* Run `bundle exec pronto run` and fix any issues it reports; these issues will also be automatically reported on the pull request
* Follow [the seven rules of a great commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Add or modify i18n translations only in the base languages, English (en) and Spanish (es); we manage all other languages through the [Crowdin integration](https://translate.consuldemocracy.org/).

When we review your pull request and ask for changes, if you're proficient using `git rebase` edit existing commits instead of adding new ones. If you aren't proficient with `git rebase`, ignore this point.
